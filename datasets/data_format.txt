Above is an example of a file of trajectories.
Every trajectory data contains two lines. The first line shows the index of the trajectory and the second line is the location points of the trajectory.
The format of the first line is "#i:", where i is the index of the trajectory.
The second line starts with a sign ">0:" that does not have any meaning. Following are the location points of the trajectory. Every point has the format "x,y" and every two points are divided by a ";".
